# Project-Scania_Truck_Cost_Prediction_Model


The dataset is highly imblanaced with a high amount of negative class and low amount of positive class, which needs to be considered for classifier model selection and evaulation. ML-Classifier algorithms like  SVC has beend excluded due to the high imbalanaced dataset. In order to build a failure cost prediction model, Boosting alghorithms and Random Forest model are considered.
